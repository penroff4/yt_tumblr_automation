The famous version was released in 1966. After \"Wednesday Morning, 3 AM\" flopped, they split up. Without either their knowledge, electric guitars and drums were added and that version of The Sound of Silence became very popular, reaching #1 on the charts in America on New Years Day, 1966. Because of this, Simon and Garfunkel teamed up again and created three more studio albums, one of which one a Grammy award for album of the year and song of the year (Bridge Over Troubled Water).", "video_title": "The Sound of Silence (Original Version from 1964)", "video_published_date": "2015-11-05T17:20:24.000Z"}, "1": {"video_playlist_position": 1, "video_id": "PGNiXGX2nLU", "video_description": "Dead Or Alive's official music video for 'You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)'.

The original version recorded on 24 October was slower than the released version, had a significantly different rhythm, and lacked the \"Why, tell me why...\" middle eight of the final version.[2][3] It was eventually released in 1996 on the Anthology 2 compilation.[4] The final version was recorded on 10 November with overdubs on 11 November and is the version included on Rubber Soul.[5]\r\n\r\nThe stereo US version of the song contains a false guitar start.\r\n\r\nAt 1:18 on the remastered mono version, feedback can be heard.\r\n\r\nIf the mono version of this song on the 2006 box set The Capitol Albums, Volume 2 has this false guitar start, it indicates that it is from the first pressing of this set which erroneously substituted incorrect mono mixes; they were simply the channels of the stereo versions combined, rather than the original mono mixes.\r\n\r\nThe album sleeve and other sources indicate that Ringo Starr played Hammond organ on this track,[2] an unusual instrument for the Beatle drummer. Mark Lewisohn reported that he could not hear the organ and that Hammond organ was not listed on the session tape box.[5] Starr plays quick two-note vamps in the choruses.[6]", "video_title": "The Beatles - I'm Looking Through You (2009 Stereo Remaster)", "video_published_date": "2016-01-26T18:41:03.000Z"}, "135": {"video_playlist_position": 135, "video_id": "5QRML-nEQ0I", "video_description": "New Project", "video_title": "The Good Life - Album of the Year (Acoustic)", "video_published_date": "2016-01-27T01:18:32.000Z"}, "136": {"video_playlist_position": 136, "video_id": "_hI0qMtdfng", "video_description": "Enjoy yourself from Late Night Delight!\n----------------------------\nLate Night Delight: http://illuminatedpaths.bandcamp.com/album/late-night-delight\n----------------------------\nSAINT PEPSI:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drinkyoung\nBandcamp: http://saintpepsi.bandcamp.com/\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/saintpepsi\n-----------------------------\nMy facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/LFSwicked\n\nFootage: Various Mac tonight commercials \n\nTags: Vaporwave Michael Jackson - off the wall", "video_title": "SAINT PEPSI - ENJOY YOURSELF (Music Video)", "video_published_date": "2016-01-28T19:17:01.000Z"}, "137": {"video_playlist_position": 137, "video_id": "OrR1TGQY20Y", "video_description": "video edited by:\nhttps://twitter.com/DavidDBurkhart\nhttps://www.facebook.com/daviddeanburkhart\n\nFor more good music, follow me on spotify: https://open.spotify.com/user/daviddeanburkhart\nI have a playlist called \"Compact Cassette\" that I update and change weekly (a regularly modified rotation, kind of like a radio station)\n\nSaint Pepsi // Cherry Pepsi // Old Pepsi Commercials\n\nFrom \"Hit Vibes\"\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/drinkyoung\nhttp://keatscollective.bandcamp.com/album/hit-vibes", "video_title": "SAINT PEPSI - Cherry Pepsi", "video_published_date": "2016-01-28T19:30:11.000Z"}, "138": {"video_playlist_position": 138, "video_id": "fF0xwNATMVw", "video_description": "Track 6 off the new Cursive album, \"I am Gemini\" on Saddle Creek Records.\n\nThis album is fantastic, go buy it on Saddle Creek's website, $9 for the whole album in mp3.", "video_title": "Double Dead - Cursive", "video_published_date": "2016-02-02T18:11:49.000Z"}, "139": {"video_playlist_position": 139, "video_id": "UhEwU3vPEcU", "video_description": "Fallout 4 OST All Soundtracks\nLink to the Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?action_edit=1&list=PL3-Zr0Ym0FgypgVXl5U4kpSldMrH2momN\nLink to my Website:\nhttp://noxsdomain.com/?page_id=4\n\nFallout 4 OST - Science Secrecy", "video_title": "Fallout 4 OST - Science Secrecy", "video_published_date": "2016-02-04T16:56:26.000Z"}, "140": {"video_playlist_position": 140, "video_id": "fd6aXM8WHGw", "video_description": "For the 20th installment of the Urban Outfitters Music Video Series, Spoon teams up with director Hiro Murai on the song \"Do You\" off Spoon's new album They Want My Soul.

I volti dei protagonisti si tingono di lacrime profonde ma inconsapevoli, come quelle di un neonato accecato dalla luce esterna e strappato via dal suo nido caldo. I visi soffrono, piangono, si contorcono. Le emozioni si confondono tra le immagini e la musica psicotropa dei Radiohead. Come solo loro sanno fare, ecco il perfetto esempio di fusione alchemica. Il pianto diventa luce, si estranea, e si riflette in un sorriso. Non \u00e8 forse quello che facciamo ogni giorno? La rabbia, il traffico, le vacanze, i litigi. Di cosa abbiamo bisogno veramente? Cosa ricerchiamo quotidianamente nelle nostre vite? Siamo farfalle, insetti, sguardi, istantanee di momenti. Siamo foglie, siamo indecisi, impariamo a cadere. Che cosa \u00e8 giusto? Cosa \u00e8 sbagliato? Siamo lacrime. Siamo sorrisi. Noi siamo emozione.

A top 10 hit single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, peaking at number eight, \"Gin and Juice\" was nominated for the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance. It was voted the 69th Greatest Rap song as ranked in rap.about.com and number eight on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.\n\nThe song's music video, directed by Dr. Dre, Calvin Caday and Anita Sisaath, also producers of GBFL's \"Dear Mama\", features a simple concept: teenager Snoop throws a wild house party after his parents leave the house. Ricky Harris plays Snoop's father, and Dr. Dre, Warren G, Nate Dogg and Daz Dillinger make cameo appearances.

Also, I didn't just take the sample and chop it up. I wanted to be as true to the mix as possible. That involved using a vintage compressor plugin for the warmth, EQ tweaking for that aged effect, some crackle and machine hiss, as well as erosion on the highs.

The band dissolved in May 1980 after the suicide of its lead singer, Ian Curtis. The remaining members reformed as New Order and went on to achieve much critical and commercial success.", "video_title": "JOY DIVISION-Transmission", "video_published_date": "2016-04-17T10:07:19.000Z"}}
